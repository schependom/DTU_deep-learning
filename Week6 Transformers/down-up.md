# Why do a downwards then upwards projection in Transformer attention?

## Short answer (intuition)

1. **Multiple subspaces / multiple views:** projecting into $P$ smaller subspaces (heads) lets the model learn _different_ attention patterns in parallel (e.g. syntax, coreference, locality).
2. **Efficiency & numerical stability:** per-head inner products use dimension $d_k$ (usually smaller), so scaling by $\sqrt{d_k}$ keeps softmax gradients stable and the matmuls fit hardware/cache better.
3. **Mixing:** the upward projection $W_O$ learns how to recombine the $P$ heads into a single $d_{\text{model}}$ representation suited for the next layer (and for the residual connection which requires dimension $d_{\text{model}}$).

## Notation and typical conventions

-   $B$ : batch size
-   $T$ : sequence length (queries)
-   $T_k$ : sequence length for keys/values (source length for cross-attention)
-   $d_{\text{model}}$ : model embedding dimension (e.g. 512)
-   $P$ : number of heads (a.k.a. $n_{\text{heads}}$, e.g. 8)
-   $d_k$ : key / query dimension per head (typ. $d_k = d_{\text{model}} / P$)
-   $d_v$ : value dimension per head (often $= d_k$)

Usually $P \cdot d_k = d_{\text{model}}$ and $P \cdot d_v = d_{\text{model}}$.

## The math (down → attention → up)

### 1) Downwards projections (linear)

We start with input

$$
X \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times T \times d_{\text{model}}}.
$$

For each head $p$ we have learned matrices

$$
W_Q^p \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}} \times d_k},\quad
W_K^p \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}} \times d_k},\quad
W_V^p \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}} \times d_v}.
$$

Project:

$$
Q^p = X W_Q^p \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times T \times d_k},\\
K^p = X W_K^p \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times T_k \times d_k},\\
V^p = X W_V^p \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times T_k \times d_v}.
$$

(Implementation note: frameworks usually compute a single big linear to get $Q,K,V$ simultaneously, then split into heads.)

### 2) Attention per head

Reshape/transpose to put head dimension before sequence:

$$
Q^p \to \text{shape }(B, P, T, d_k),\quad
K^p \to (B, P, T_k, d_k),\quad
V^p \to (B, P, T_k, d_v).
$$

Compute scaled dot-product scores and values:

$$
\text{scores}^p = \frac{Q^p (K^p)^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}} \quad\text{shape }(B, P, T, T_k)
$$

$$
\text{weights}^p = \text{softmax}(\text{scores}^p + M)\quad\text{shape }(B, P, T, T_k)
$$

$$
\text{head}_p = \text{weights}^p \; V^p \quad\text{shape }(B, P, T, d_v)
$$

### 3) Upwards projection (concatenate + mix)

Concatenate heads along the feature axis:

$$
\text{concat} = \text{Concat}_\text{heads}(\text{head}_1,\dots,\text{head}_P)
\quad\text{shape }(B, T, P \cdot d_v)
$$

Apply final output projection:

$$
W_O \in \mathbb{R}^{(P \cdot d_v)\times d_{\text{model}}}
$$

$$
\text{Output} = \text{concat}\; W_O \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times T \times d_{\text{model}}}
$$

This output has the same dimension as $X$, enabling the residual connection:

$$
\text{LayerOut} = \text{LayerNorm}(X + \text{Output}).
$$

## PyTorch-style implementation sketch (shapes)

```py
# x: (B, T, d_model)
qkv = qkv_proj(x)                                           # (B, T, 3*d_model)  (computed by a single linear for efficiency)
q, k, v = qkv.chunk(3, dim=-1)                              # each (B, T, d_model)

# reshape into heads
q = q.view(B, T, P, d_k).transpose(1, 2)    # (B, P, T, d_k)
k = k.view(B, T_k, P, d_k).transpose(1, 2)  # (B, P, T_k, d_k)
v = v.view(B, T_k, P, d_v).transpose(1, 2)  # (B, P, T_k, d_v)

scores = torch.matmul(q, k.transpose(-2, -1)) / math.sqrt(d_k)  # (B, P, T, T_k)
weights = torch.softmax(scores + mask, dim=-1)                  # (B, P, T, T_k)
head_out = torch.matmul(weights, v)                             # (B, P, T, d_v)

# combine heads
head_out = head_out.transpose(1, 2).contiguous().view(B, T, P * d_v)  # (B, T, P*d_v)
out = out_proj(head_out)  # (B, T, d_model)
```

## Why this design (detailed reasons)

1. **Representational diversity**
   Each head $p$ has its own $W_Q^p, W_K^p, W_V^p$ so it can learn _a different similarity metric_ / focus pattern. Concatenating heads gives the model the ability to represent multiple relations simultaneously.

2. **Numerical stability & scaling**
   Using $d_k$ smaller and scaling by $\sqrt{d_k}$ stabilizes softmax and gradients. If $d_k$ were large, dot products would be large in magnitude causing softmax to be too peaky or gradients to vanish.

3. **Hardware efficiency and locality**
   Smaller matmuls per head fit caches better, can map well to parallel compute (multi-GPU / multi-core), and often result in better throughput than a single huge matmul — even though aggregate FLOPs are comparable when $P \cdot d_k = d_{\text{model}}$.

4. **Parameter & capacity trade-off**
   If $P \cdot d_k = d_{\text{model}}$, total parameters for $W_Q, W_K, W_V$ are similar to a single big projection. But splitting into heads gives more flexible parameter structure (separate projections per head) which increases representational capacity for the same overall dimension.

5. **Learned mixing (output projection)**
   $W_O$ is crucial: it learns to combine the different head outputs into a single coherent representation. Without it, you’d have separate head channels that can’t interact.

6. **Residual connections require $d_{\text{model}}$**
   The layer output must match $d_{\text{model}}$ to add back to the input $X$ in the residual connection. The upward projection ensures that.

## Example numeric intuition

-   $d_{\text{model}}=512$, $P=8$ → $d_k = d_v = 64$.
-   Per-head matmul for scores: each head does $\sim T \times T \times 64$ multiplications; across 8 heads this sums to $\sim T \times T \times 512$ — same total FLOPs as one monolithic head of size 512.
    **But** the split allows diverse attention patterns and better numerical behavior plus practical implementation and parallelism advantages.

---

## Final compact formulas

$$
\text{head}_p = \text{Attention}(X W_Q^p,; X W_K^p,; X W_V^p)
$$

$$
\text{MultiHead}(X) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1,\dots,\text{head}_P); W_O
$$

where

$$
\text{Attention}(Q,K,V) = \text{softmax}!\left(\frac{Q K^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}} + M\right) V.
$$

---

## TL;DR

-   **Downwards**: linear projections map $d_{\text{model}}$ into multiple small head subspaces ($d_k$) so each head can learn a different attention pattern and numerical stability is improved.
-   **Upwards**: $W_O$ recombines the head outputs into $d_{\text{model}}$ so the residual connection and subsequent layers keep a consistent dimension and can use a learned mixture of what each head produced.
